## NEEDLE: Necessary Elements for Deep Learning Library
## Sparse Matrix Extension for NEEDLE

In the final project, we added the support for sparse matrices to our needle library. Specifically, the following features were implemented:

1) sparse matrix construction and dense conversion

2) sparse matrix operations

3) auto-differentiation

4) support for CPU, CUDA backends

Finally, we used our needle library to construct a Graph Convolutional Network and trained it on a document classification task using Cora dataset.
